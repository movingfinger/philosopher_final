## Introduction  

#### About This Project
This project is about [Dining Philosopher Problem]. There are n number of philosophers sitting on the table with same number of forks which each fork is put between two philosophers and spagetti is on the table center. We need to make sure to philosophers not starving. 

#### About Me
Developer, Designer Be creative!! Currently Studying [@42SiliconValley][42]

#### About 42  
[42][42] is a free, non profit, project-based, peer-to-peer learning coding school. It originated in France and now has over 20 campuses all over the world. More information can be found [here][42] 

## Objective 
Use ptrhead to handle this problem.

## Instructions
Make sure you have the needed [dependencies](#dependencies) before proceeding.
For instructions and/or greater detail refer to the project [pdf][pdf]

## Mandatory part
Three Steps, [1] Use mutex to handle dining philosopher problem and philosopher shoud be thread. [2] Use semaphore instead of mutex, and now forks are placed on table center. [3] Same situation as [2], but each philosopher should be a process and the main process should not be a philosopher.
## Bonus part
There is no bonus part for this project.

## Dependencies  
* A C language compiler most common would be GCC or Clang.
* These were written to run on Unix based systems, it would likely work on a windows machine too but is currently untested.
